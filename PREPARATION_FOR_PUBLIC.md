# Guide: Preparing MyVidVault for Public Distribution

This guide outlines the necessary steps to clean the project directory, removing sensitive information and unnecessary files before sharing it publicly or committing it to a public version control repository.

## 1. Remove Sensitive Environment Variables

The `.env` file contains secrets such as database credentials and your Django secret key. **This file must never be made public.**

*   **Action**: Delete the `.env` file from the project directory.

    ```bash
    rm .env
    ```

## 2. Verify the Example Environment File

The `.env_example` file serves as a template for users, listing all the environment variables the application needs to run.

*   **Action**: Ensure your `.env_example` file is up-to-date and accurately reflects all the variables required in the `.env` file, but without any of the secret values.

    **Example `.env_example` content:**
    ```
    # Django SECRET_KEY
    SECRET_KEY=

    # PostgreSQL Database credentials
    DB_NAME=
    DB_USER=
    DB_PASSWORD=
    DB_HOST=db
    DB_PORT=5432

    # Uvicorn workers
    WEB_CONCURRENCY=4

    # Allowed Hosts for Django (comma-separated)
    # Example: ALLOWED_HOSTS=mydomain.com,www.mydomain.com
    ALLOWED_HOSTS=
    ```

## 3. Clean the Frontend Directory

The `frontend/dist` and `frontend/node_modules` directories are generated during the build process. They are not needed in the source repository as they can be large and are generated by the end-user.

*   **Action**: Remove these directories if they exist.

    ```bash
    # Remove the build output
    rm -rf frontend/dist

    # Remove installed dependencies
    rm -rf frontend/node_modules
    ```

## 4. Review for Hardcoded Secrets

As a best practice, quickly review the application code to ensure no secrets (like API keys or passwords) have been accidentally hardcoded. The current project structure appears clean, but this is always a good final check.

After following these steps, your project folder is sanitized and ready for public distribution.
